Happy or Sad Classification 😊😢
This project is a simple deep learning application that classifies a person's facial expression as happy or sad based on an uploaded photo. The model is trained using images of happy and sad people organized in separate folders.

🧠 Model Training
You can train the model using the dataset in the Data/ folder.

Adjust the paths in the script if needed.

After training, the model is saved as happy_sad_model.h5 inside the model/ folder.

📁 Dataset Preparation
Ensure the Data/ directory has two folders:

happy_people/: Contains images of happy faces.

sad_people/: Contains images of sad faces.

Each folder should have at least 100 images for better training accuracy.

Make sure the images are clear and of consistent dimensions.
